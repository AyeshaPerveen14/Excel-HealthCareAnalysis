## Project Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic healthcare dataset to identify patterns in medical conditions, patient demographics, test results, hospital admissions, billing, insurance utilization, and clinical operations. The analysis aims to generate actionable insights to improve healthcare delivery, operational efficiency, and policy decision-making.

## Data Source

This dataset was provided by Onyx Data as part of their April 2025 Data DNA Challenge

## Key Insights

## Patient & Condition Demographics

* The dataset represents 55,500 unique patients.
* Top 3 medical conditions by patient count: Hypertension, Diabetes, and Obesity, each affecting over 12,000 patients
* Gender distribution is Female (50%), Male (40%), and Non-binary (10%)
* Age is fairly spread between 21 and 80, with a concentration in the 31–70 age range
* Test results show 55% of patients had abnormal results, while only 10% were normal
  
## Condition Distribution by Gender & Blood Type

* Hypertension and Diabetes are more common among females
* Blood types A+ and O+ dominate among patients with chronic conditions
* Asthma and Cancer appear less frequently compared to other chronic illnesses

## Test Results vs Medical Condition
* Diabetes is associated with both abnormal and inconclusive results
* Arthritis had only normal test results, suggesting non-critical pathology
* Obesity had entirely inconclusive results, warranting further investigation

## Admissions & Hospital Trends

* Patient admissions increased steadily from 2019 to 2023, peaking in 2023
* Houston Methodist Hospital leads with over 20,000 admissions
* Top 3 hospitals alone account for more than 70% of total admissions

## Insurance Utilization & Billing

* Medicare covers 50% of all patients and contributes to nearly $707M in billing
* Total billing across all providers exceeds $1.42B
* Asthma and Obesity incur the highest average billing, both over $25,600

## Medication Usage

* Hypertension and Diabetes show high usage across all medication types
* Cancer and Arthritis patients are consistently prescribed all 5 major medications

## Admission Types & Doctor Performance

* Elective, Emergency, and Urgent admissions are evenly distributed across conditions
* Michael Smith is the top doctor by patient count (27), followed by two other Smiths and two Johnsons

## Recommendations

* Improve screening for chronic conditions such as Hypertension and Diabetes, especially for patients with A+/O+ blood types.
* Increase awareness and testing efforts for obesity, given the high rate of inconclusive results.
* Target resource allocation at top hospitals like Houston Methodist and Johns Hopkins to ensure service delivery can meet growing patient volume.
* Review and audit Medicare billing practices, as it accounts for half of patient coverage and nearly half of total billing.
* Standardize medication protocols for conditions showing high variance in prescription patterns.

## Conclusion

This healthcare analysis revealed patterns in patient demographics, medical conditions, test outcomes, billing practices, and hospital operations. These insights can inform stakeholders, from healthcare providers to policymakers, on how to optimize healthcare delivery, allocate resources, and prioritize patient wellness across the board. The data emphasizes the importance of early detection, continuous monitoring, and targeted interventions in chronic disease management.
